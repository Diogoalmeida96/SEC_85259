mem size c= 32kB
word size = 8b

number of words = 32kB/8b = 32k words 

memory size chip = 2^10 = 1KB
word size chip = 8 = 8-bit ram module

number of chips = 32 k / 1 k = 32 chips

address bits

select each chip => 32 chips = 2⁵ therefore 5 bits are required

10 bits are required to address each chip
